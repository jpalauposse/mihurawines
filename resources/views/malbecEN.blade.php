                Variety: Malbec
                <br>
                <br>
                Origin: Luján de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina. 671 masl / 2201 ft. Manual harvest last week of March
                <br>
                <br>
                Vinification: Grapes manually harvested were placed in stainless steel tanks and left to stand at low temperature for 3 days, in which 10% of the liquid was removed to increase the concentration. Then high quality organic dry active yeasts are placed. At the beginning a temperature controlled fermentation was carried out, which never exceeds 25ºC. The fermentation process lasts 14 days, with pumps that constantly stir the wine. After removing the skins, it was left in contact with the lees for a month to surround the edges. It is then naturally malolactic fermented. Once this process was completed, the wine was placed in second-use American oak barrels for 12 months.

                Tasting Notes: Deep purple. This wine has aromas of red fruits such as cherries and strawberries. It has some floral notes of violet and hints of vanilla given its aging in wood. In the mouth it is vibrant and round with ripe tannins.
