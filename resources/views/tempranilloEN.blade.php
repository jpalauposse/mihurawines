                Vinification: Manual harvesting of bunches before de-stemming and pressing. Ganymede system, more maceration in less time (unlike traditional). Developing greater intensity of colour and more softness in the mouth. Fermentation for 6 days at controlled temperatures between 22ºC and 24ºC, to obtain greater complexity in the mouth.

                Tasting Notes: Intense ruby red, with bluish hues, denoting youth. On the nose it is fresh and elegant, with fruity notes, with notes of plum and vanilla. On the palate, it is harmonious and round, where the tannins, very present but friendly, highlight its personality.
