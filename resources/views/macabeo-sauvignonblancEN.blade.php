                Vinification: Manual harvesting of bunches before de-stemming and pressing. Small pre-fermentation maceration for 8 hours, to achieve greater aromatic extraction. Static and complex settling for 48 hours at temperatures around 7ºC. Fermentation for 25 days at controlled temperatures between 12ºC and 16ºC with selected yeasts, to favor the extraction of greater aromatic expressiveness.

                Tasting Notes: Pale yellow in colour, displays steely reflections with bright details. On the nose it is delicate and clean, with fresh grape notes (herbs, freshly cut grass) with hints of banana fruits and apples. In the mouth, round and smooth, it confirms the aromatic palette, with a fresh and smooth entry, leaving a long lingering, slightly unctuous memory.

                Food Pairing: Ideal to accompany seafood, sea and lagoon fish, potato omelets and soft cheeses.
