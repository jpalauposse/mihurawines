                <br>
                Origen: Ciudad Real, Castilla La Mancha, España. 723 msmn / 2372 ft. Manual harvest, second week of September
                <br>
                <br>
                Vinification: Manual harvesting of bunches before de-stemming and pressing. 90% Tempranillo; 10% Petit Verdot; made separately, tasty combined. Ganymede system, greater maceration in less time (unlike traditional), to obtain greater fruitiness. Fermentation for 14 days at controlled temperatures of 24ºC. After malolactic fermentation, it is aged in American oak barrels for 6 months and 12 months in tank.

                Tasting Notes: Intense garnet, with sharp reflections, bright and clean. On the nose it is complex, with fruity and floral notes, with aromas from the aging in oak of first use. Full and balanced. Harmonic and tasty on the palate, due to juicy tannins that provide smoothness and a long finish in the mouth.
