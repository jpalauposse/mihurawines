                Vinification: Grapes manually harvested were placed in stainless steel tanks and left to stand at low temperature for 3 days. Then high quality organic dry active yeasts are placed. At the beginning a temperature control fermentation was carried out, which never exceeds 25ºC. The fermentation process lasts 14 days, with pumps that constantly stir the wine. After removing the skins, it was left in contact with the lees for a month to surround the edges. It is then naturally malolactic fermented.
