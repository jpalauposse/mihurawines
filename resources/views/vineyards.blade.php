                <h4>Vineyard La Mancha, Spain</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="texto"> The vineyards are located on the bed of the Guadiana river. These waters together with limestone soils make them meet special natural geological and microclimatic conditions that are very favorable for growing of grapes.

                <h4>Vineyard Luján de Cuyo, Argentina</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="texto">On the foothills of the Andes Mountain is the department of Luján de Cuyo, the altitude is around 650 meters above sea level. Average temperatures are 15 degrees, with a high temperature range between day and night.

                    <br> 
                    Undoubtedly, we are talking about the most excellent terroirs for winemaking and more particularly Malbec, Argentina's emblematic strain, which despite its French origin was in Mendoza where it found the ideal conditions to develop its best expression. The alluvial soil is made up of a stony subsoil where sand, silt and clay settle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This soil is poor in organic matter, limiting the excessive growth of the vines, making them excellent for the production of quality wines. This conjunction of factors undoubtedly results in a Malbec with outstanding characteristics.
